Project Overview
To develop a predictive model for estimating house prices by leveraging advanced regression techniques, improving accuracy and reliability over traditional methods.
Key Components:
1. Data Collection: Gather property, location, and economic data.
2.Preprocessing: Clean data, engineer features, and scale variables.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data and analyze feature relationships
4.Model Selection: Use techniques like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
5.Evaluation: Assess model performance with metrics like MAE and MSE; use cross-validation.
6.Tuning: Optimize hyperparameters and select key features
7.Results: Report accuracy and insights; address challenges and limitations.
